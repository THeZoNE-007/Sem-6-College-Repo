Q1> (The Rectangle class)

Design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle.
The class contains:
Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle.
A no-arg constructor that creates a rectangle with width 1 and height 1.
A constructor that creates a default rectangle with the specified width and height.
A function named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
A function named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.

Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objects. Assign width 4 and height 40 to the first object and width 3.5 and height 35.9 to the second. Display the properties of both
objects and find their areas and perimeters.

Q2> (The MyPoint class)

Design a class named MyPoint to represent a point with x and y-coordinates. The class contains:
Two data fields x and y that represent the coordinates.
A no-arg constructor that creates a point (0, 0).
A constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates.
Two get functions for data fields x and y, respectively.
A function named distance that returns the distance from this point to another point of the MyPoint type.
Write a test program that creates two points (0, 0) and (10, 30.5) and displays the distance between them.
