Assignment: Metasploit & Msfcli Hands-on
Question 1: Metasploit Basics
Explain the difference between a bind shell and a reverse shell in Metasploit. Provide an example of when you would use each.
Question 2: Searching for Exploits
Use Metasploit to search for vulnerabilities related to Ubuntu. Write the command you used and list any two exploits you found.
Question 3: Exploit Module Configuration 
You have identified ms08_067_netapi as an exploit for a Windows XP target. Write the Metasploit commands to:
1.	Use the exploit
2.	Show the available options
3.	Set the target IP to 192.168.1.100
4.	Set the payload to windows/shell_reverse_tcp
Question 4: Msfcli Execution 
Using Msfcli, write a single command to exploit a Windows XP machine at 192.168.1.100 using ms08_067_netapi with a bind shell payload.
Question 5: Understanding Exploit Execution 
After executing an exploit in Metasploit, explain what happens step by step when a reverse shell is used. Include:
•	What Metasploit does when you run exploit
•	How the target machine responds
•	How the attacker gains access
